## PETA METRO

Peta Metro is a simple website to view all the transit / metro maps from all over the world! I made this website using React mainly.

You can take a look at the code by yourself to see how it works under the hood. Mind you it is not the best code as I am a beginner!

There is a Figma file here: [Figma Link - Click Here!](https://www.figma.com/design/mH4kWP89WCstCDsqaF5076/Peta-Metro?node-id=1-18&t=f3vmStmTUKVkgXfS-1).

**Enjoy the website!**
